    <h1>1, 2, 3, Flash!</h1>
    <h4> Medium: Code (P5.js)

    <p>Using the Processing Software, I created a drawing/sketch of a simple camera using code. I decided to draw a camera since photography is my passion, so I wanted to create a simple yet cool animation.
      I then decided to make my camera interactive by using P5.js, I added a function that if the mouse is pressed, the flash on my camera appears to go off, as if it were taking a picture. I also decided to add colorful particles
      that follow the mouse whenever you roam around the screen, also when the mouse is pressed the particles start to vanish for as long as you keep the mouse held down. They reappear once you let go, it's as if whenever you press the mouse you take a picture
      which makes the flash go off and therefore, it pushes the particles away.
    <br>
    <br>
     Not knowing much about coding, I was actually pretty satisfied with the outcome of my camera because it represents me, it represents what I do.
   It was hard trying to get the functions to work, but in the end my piece as a whole ended up working. </p>
