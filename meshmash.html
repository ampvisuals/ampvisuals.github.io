<h1>Modern Venus</h1>
<h4> Medium: Virtual 3D Sculpture</h4>
<br>
<br>
<p>
  My project consists of three 3D objects combined to make one piece. I created Modern Venus as a way of recreating and modernizing The Birth of Venus. My first project was also about this artwork, so I decided to combine my passion for photography with one of my favorite paintings to create what would be a modern statue of Venus. I added a surrounding geometric structure to enclose venus inside of it, this was just done aesthetically to make it more pleasing. The environment is a simple studio setting where lights shine on my sculpture, giving it a feeling of it being displayed in a museum or gallery.
<br>
<br>
Being interested in Classical art, this creation is done as a display of an elegant sculpture. I wanted to continue to spread classical art, yet combining it and giving it a touch of modern. The purpose was to allow the viewer to feel as if they were in a unique, luxurious, and exclusive place where a fancy and expensive sculpture is displayed.</p>
