<h1>Put it Down, Live the Moment</h1>
<h4> Medium: Video</h4>
<br>
<br>
<p>My video focuses on "Technology Changing What it Means to be Human," my take on this focuses specifically on the negative effects technology has, not only on us, but on parents and their kids as well. Nowadays, parents are always on their phones, either for business purposes, for entertainment, or simply for "fun" and in doing so they set their kids aside. To keep their kids occupied and not bothering them they have also used technology as a distraction, as a device to keep their kids quiet. Kids no longer go outside to play or to make friends, they no longer use their imagination to have fun. Kids are losing their human abilities like communication and social skills, they are being consumed by technology. Kids no longer bond with their parents, there's no quality time being spent with each other and that to me is devastating.
  <br>
<br>
I created this video to bring awareness to this issue, this issue which is changing the way we humans once were. In my video, a child begins running outside and then it cuts to a person using a cell phone. Then it goes back to the kid and to the phone once again, this was due to show what a kid should be doing and then to demonstrate what is actually happening. The person on the phone could be seen as the kid himself, or it could be the parent. Either way, a kid should be outside having fun and not inside or being ignored by their parents due to technology. It then moves on to a clip of a phone breaking, which is self-explanatory, get rid of your phone, stop using your phone, or just break it! In the end, you see the result of getting rid of the phone, the result is both a parent spending time with their child, and most importantly a happy child enjoying the outdoors.</p>
